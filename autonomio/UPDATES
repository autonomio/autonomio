- streamline adding new parameters !!! 
- rename flatten to something else
- make print outs a parameter option
- some shapes have many 1 neuron in later layers
- what should be the defaul setting for dims, I think auto
- how we should deal with nans
- does max_neuron make any difference now? 
- how about neuron last? Should this be automatic? 
- are we randomizing in the validation process?


- fixed a lot of things from y_transform (too many really :s)
- added to_categorical.py for automating 
- added wrangler() to commands.py to call to_categorical
- hiding Keras outputs if verbose is 0
- added comments to shapes.py
