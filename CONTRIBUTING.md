## 1. Ways to contribute <a name="one"></a>

There are several ways programmers, data scientists and others can contribute to Autonomio. 

#### 1.1. Contributing Code 

##### 1.1.1. Contribute to Open Issues

It will be great if you can contribute some code to Autonomio. To do this, the best way is to: 

1) check out the [open issues](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/issues)
2) join the conversation and share your willingness to contribute 
3) somebody will help you get started / provide more details if needed
4) fork [the current dev](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/issues#fork-destination-box) branch
5) make your changes to your own fork/repo
6) test, test, test 
7) if it's a new feature, make changes to test_script.py accordingly 
8) make sure that Travis build passes
9) come back and make a pull request

What we really try to avoid, is being this guy...

#### 1.1.2. Contribute to a New Idea 

Same as above, but start by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/issues/new) to open a discussion on the idea you have for contribution.

### 1.2. Contributing Ideas 

In case you don't want to contribute code, but have a feature request or some other idea, that is a great contribution as well and will be much appreciated. You can do it by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/issues/new).

### 1.3. Contributing Testing 

In case you don't want to contribute code, but have a feature request or some other idea, that is a great contribution as well and will be much appreciated. You can do it by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/issues/new). 

**Testing comes in two forms:** 

#### 1.3.1 actual testing

Just use Autonomio for any open challenge you are working on. Or pick one from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions).

1) Work with Autonomion in data science challenges
2) Try a lot of different things
3) [Report issues](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/issues/new) as you may find them

#### 1.3.2 improving code coverage

We're using [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io) for code coverage testing, and even the smallest contributions to this end help a great deal. 

1) Follow the instructions in section 1.1 and 1.3.1
2) Use your own fork to see how the results improve in comparison to [current Master](https://coveralls.io/github/autonomio/core-module)

### 1.4. Contributing Something Else

Last but not least, if there is something you want to do what was not covered in the above sections, please share more by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/issues/new).


### 1.5. Contributing to Manual / Documentation 

We're using [Readthedocs](http://readthedocs.io) for documentation. See the latest [Autonomio documentation build](http://autonomio.readthedocs.io) for a reference of current status. The goal is to have comprehensive documentation, enough so that 100% of the actual practical capability is covered in terms of clear instructions. The documentation is automatically built from changes to [docs/index.rst](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/tree/master/docs).

To contribute to the Manual, you have two options: 

- The pro way: follow the steps in section 1.1
- A simpler way: follow the steps in section 1.4
