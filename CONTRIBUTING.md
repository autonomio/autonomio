# Contributing to Autonomio

First I want to thank you A LOT for considering / taking the effort to contribute code to Autonomio. Below you will find some simple and mostly obvious guidelines on how to do it in the most valuable way.

To make sure that you're on the same page, for a a high level overview of the scope, see [Autonomio website](http://autonom.io) or for a a detailed overview of the current functionality, see [Autonomio documentation](http://autonomio.readthedocs.io).

## 1. Ways to contribute

There are several ways programmers, data scientists and others can contribute to Autonomio. 

#### 1.1. Contributing Code 

##### 1.1.1. Contribute to Open Issues

It will be great if you can contribute some code to Autonomio. To do this, the best way is to: 

1) check out the [open issues](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/issues)
2) join the conversation and share your willingness to contribute 
3) somebody will help you get started / provide more details if needed
4) fork [the current dev](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/issues#fork-destination-box) branch
5) make your changes to your own fork/repo
6) test, test, test 
7) if it's a new feature, make changes to test_script.py accordingly 
8) make sure that Travis build passes
9) come back and make a pull request

What we really try to avoid, is being this guy...

##### 1.1.2. Contribute to a New Idea 

Same as above, but start by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/issues/new) to open a discussion on the idea you have for contribution.

#### 1.2. Contributing Ideas 

In case you don't want to contribute code, but have a feature request or some other idea, that is a great contribution as well and will be much appreciated. You can do it by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/issues/new).

#### 1.3. Contributing Testing 

In case you don't want to contribute code, but have a feature request or some other idea, that is a great contribution as well and will be much appreciated. You can do it by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/issues/new). 

**Testing comes in two forms:** 

##### 1.3.1 actual testing

Just use Autonomio for any open challenge you are working on. Or pick one from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions).

1) Work with Autonomion in data science challenges
2) Try a lot of different things
3) [Report issues](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/issues/new) as you may find them

##### 1.3.2 improving code coverage

We're using [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io) for code coverage testing, and even the smallest contributions to this end help a great deal. 

1) Follow the instructions in section 1.1 and 1.3.1
2) Use your own fork to see how the results improve in comparison to [current Master](https://coveralls.io/github/autonomio/core-module)

#### 1.4. Contributing Something Else

Last but not least, if there is something you want to do what was not covered in the above sections, please share more by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/autonomio/core-module/issues/new).
